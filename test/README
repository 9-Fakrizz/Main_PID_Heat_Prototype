This directory is intended for PlatformIO Test Runner and project tests.

Unit Testing is a software testing method by which individual units of
source code, sets of one or more MCU program modules together with associated
control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to
determine whether they are fit for use. Unit testing finds problems early
in the development cycle.

#Issue

### Critical ESP32 Boot Pins

The ESP32 has certain **strapping pins** that decide the boot mode.
If they are pulled HIGH/LOW incorrectly, the board won’t enter the USB programming mode:

* **GPIO0** → Must be HIGH for normal boot (LOW = flash mode)
* **GPIO2** → Must be LOW at boot, otherwise boot fails
* **GPIO15** → Must be LOW at boot
* **GPIO12** → Controls flash voltage, if pulled HIGH the ESP may not boot

---

### In Circuit

* **GPIO2 → Relay1** 

  * If the relay board pulls GPIO2 HIGH, upload will fail.

* **GPIO15 → Relay2** 

  * Same problem, it must be LOW at boot.

* **GPIO12 → SO** 

  * Same problem, it must be LOW at boot.

* **GPIO0 → Not shown** (good, but make sure nothing is connected)


---

###  How to Fix

1. **Disconnect relay1 (GPIO2) and relay2 (GPIO15) during upload**
   → Just unplug them or add jumpers so you can disconnect when flashing.

2. Or **use different GPIO pins** for the relays.

   * Good safe pins for relays: **GPIO 23, 27, 14**

3. After upload, you can reconnect them and run normally.
